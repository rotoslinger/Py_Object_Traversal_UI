# Py_Object_Traversal_UI
A simple UI to help you traverse python classes and properties. Documentation, and help included!

This should work for maya versions 2020 - 2024.

## Am too lazy to automate forward and backward compatibility.

For maya2019 and lower, instead of PySide2 and shiboken2 use PySide and shiboken

For maya2025 and higher, instead of PySide2 and shiboken2 use PySide6 and shiboken6

## Will get around to automating compatibility when am not too lazy

## enjoy!
